# Installing on UNRAID

Currently Stash is supported in Unraid via the [Community Applications][unraid-community-applications] plugin.

As of April 6, 2020 the Stash app is now published to the container directory as well. 
Please install and use Stash with that template. 

Unraid specific support can be found [here][unraid-docker-support].

!!! info
    For users that want to try the development branch of Stash you can change the repo to `stashapp/stash:development`.
